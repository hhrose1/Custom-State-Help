  <h2>Lease Agreement Red Flags</h2>

  <!-- Big disclaimer -->
  <div class="disclaimer-box">
    <strong>Important:</strong>
    <span>
      This page gives general examples of lease red flags. What is legal or enforceable
      can depend on your state, city, and the exact wording in your lease. This is
      <strong>not legal advice</strong>. If something on your lease worries you, talk to a
      tenant legal aid organization or a licensed attorney in your area.

      These are common issues to watch for <em>before you sign, renew, or move in</em>.
      You can use this as a checklist when reading your lease.

  <!-- Maintenance & repairs -->
  <section id="maintenance" class="flag-section">
    <h3>Maintenance & Repairs</h3>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Vague or missing maintenance responsibilities</h4>
      <p>
        If the lease doesn’t clearly say who handles repairs, appliances, pest control, and HVAC,
        the landlord may later claim everything is “tenant responsibility.”
        A good lease says <em>who handles what</em> and how to request repairs.

  <!-- Fees & money -->
  <section id="fees" class="flag-section">
    <h3>Fees, Deposits & Money</h3>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Excessive or unclear fees</h4>
      <p>
        Watch for vague charges like “administrative fees,” “convenience fees,” or unspecified
        move-in/move-out fees. If a fee is not itemized or explained in writing, that’s a red flag.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">No grace period for rent</h4>
      <p>
        If late fees start the morning rent is due with no grace period, expect strict enforcement.
        Some areas require a short grace period by law.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Extremely high or daily late fees</h4>
      <p>
        Very high flat late fees or fees that grow daily can add up quickly. Some states cap late
        fees or require that they be “reasonable.” Anything that seems punitive is a warning sign.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Unclear security deposit rules</h4>
      <p>
        A lease should say how much the deposit is, where it is held (if your state requires this),
        what deductions are allowed, and when it must be returned. Vague or missing deposit rules
        often lead to disputes at move-out.

  <!-- Lease term & renewal -->
  <section id="term-renewal" class="flag-section">
    <h3>Lease Length, Renewal, and Leaving Early</h3>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Unfair or missing early termination rules</h4>
      <p>
        If breaking the lease means paying all remaining rent with no exceptions, that is a big
        financial risk. Some leases allow a fixed lease-break fee or re-rental process instead.
        Look for what happens if you need to move for safety, health, or job reasons.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Automatic renewal without clear notice</h4>
      <p>
        Some leases automatically renew for another full term if you don’t give written notice
        (for example, 60 days before the end date). If you miss the window, you may be locked in
        for another year. Make sure renewal rules and notice deadlines are clear.

  <!-- Privacy & entry -->
  <section id="privacy" class="flag-section">
    <h3>Privacy, Inspections & Landlord Entry</h3>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Landlord can enter “at any time for any reason”</h4>
      <p>
        Most places require landlords to give notice before entering your home except in an
        emergency. A lease that allows entry “at any time” with no notice or reason is a serious
        privacy red flag.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Very restrictive guest rules</h4>
      <p>
        Reasonable guest limits are common, but rules that completely ban guests or severely limit
        overnight visitors can be a sign of a controlling landlord or management company.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <!-- Legal rights & discrimination -->
  <section id="rights" class="flag-section">
    <h3>Legal Rights, Fair Housing & Discrimination</h3>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Clauses that “waive” your legal rights</h4>
      <p>
        Be cautious of any statement like “tenant waives right to sue,” “tenant waives right to
        a jury trial,” or “landlord not responsible for anything, even if negligent.” Many of
        these are not enforceable, but including them is a major red flag.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Illegal or discriminatory terms</h4>
      <p>
        Some examples include blanket bans on emotional support animals where the law requires
        accommodation, charging extra rent for ESAs, or rules that appear to target certain
        groups of people. Fair housing protections are different by state, but anything that
        looks discriminatory deserves a closer look and legal advice.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Hidden rules in “house rules” or extra documents</h4>
      <p>
        Leases sometimes push restrictive rules into separate documents like “community
        policies” or “house rules” that can change at any time. Always ask for copies of
        every addendum, rulebook, or policy mentioned in the lease before you sign.
      </p>

  <!-- Utilities & extra rules -->
  <section id="utilities" class="flag-section">
    <h3>Utilities, Cleaning & Extra Requirements</h3>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Mandatory move-out cleaning with one specific company</h4>
      <p>
        Some leases require you to pay a particular cleaning company at move-out. This can be
        used to charge inflated or unnecessary fees. It’s a red flag if you have no choice
        or if prices are not clearly disclosed.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Renter’s insurance required through one provider</h4>
      <p>
        Landlords can usually require renter’s insurance, but you should be allowed to choose
        the insurance company. Being forced to buy through one specific provider can be a sign
        of unnecessary extra cost.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="flag-card">
      <h4 class="flag-title">Utility billing that hides how charges are calculated</h4>
      <p>
        Examples include “ratio billing” where utilities are split among tenants but the math is
        not explained, or flat “utility fees” that can be increased later at the landlord’s
        discretion. If you can’t tell how your bill is calculated, ask questions before signing.
