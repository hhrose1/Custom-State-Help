        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Before signing, carefully review:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rent amount, due date, late fees, and how rent must be paid</li>
            <li>Which utilities are included versus what you must set up and pay for</li>
            <li>Security deposit amount, conditions for refunds, and cleaning/damage rules</li>
            <li>Maintenance and repair responsibilities (who fixes what, and how fast)</li>
            <li>Guest, pet, parking, storage, and noise rules</li>
            <li>Move-in / move-out inspection procedures</li>
            <li>Rules around subletting, re-renting, or assigning your lease</li>
            <li>Early termination / lease-break policies and any fees</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ask specifically what happens if you need to leave early (job relocation, safety concerns, domestic
            violence, military orders, etc.). Always ask for changes or promises in <strong>writing</strong> before you sign.</p>

          <span class="icon">▶</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. You should always do a walkthrough before moving in and document everything. Look for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Leaks, stains, soft drywall, bubbling paint, or musty smells (possible mold)</li>
            <li>Evidence of pests: droppings, chewed food packaging, dead insects, or rust-colored stains on bedding</li>
            <li>Rodent signs: gnaw marks, rice-shaped droppings, noises in walls at night</li>
            <li>Broken locks, windows that do not close properly, or doors that do not latch</li>
            <li>Non-working appliances, outlets, lights, or smoke/CO detectors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Take clear photos and email them to the landlord <strong>right away</strong> so there is a written record that
            these issues existed before you moved in.</p>

          <span class="icon">▶</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes — existing residents can give honest information that you might not get from management. You can ask:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“When things break, how quickly do they fix them?”</li>
            <li>“Do you feel safe in the building and parking areas at night?”</li>
            <li>“Have you noticed pests, leaks, mold, or other ongoing problems?”</li>
            <li>“Is management easy to reach and reasonable to work with?”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If multiple people report the same problem, take it seriously and factor it into your decision.</p>

          <span class="icon">▶</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Renters insurance is often required by leases and is strongly recommended even when it isn’t. It typically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Covers your personal belongings if they are stolen or damaged by certain events</li>
            <li>Provides personal liability coverage if someone is hurt in your unit</li>
            <li>May cover temporary housing if your unit becomes uninhabitable (policy-specific)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Policies commonly cost around <strong>$10–20 per month</strong>. Check if you can bundle it with your car
            insurance for a discount.</p>

          <span class="icon">▶</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes, landlords often check credit and income as part of screening. If your credit is low, you may be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a co-signer or guarantor</li>
            <li>Show proof of consistent income or savings</li>
            <li>Offer a larger deposit, if allowed by law</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Screening standards vary by landlord and by state. Ask what alternatives they accept if you’re worried about credit.</p>

          <span class="icon">▶</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Always request repairs in <strong>writing</strong> (email is best). Include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A clear description of the problem</li>
            <li>Photos or videos if possible</li>

          <span class="label">What is “rent escrow” and when can I use it?</span>
          <span class="icon">▶</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Rent escrow is a legal process where, instead of paying rent directly to your landlord, you pay it to a court
            or government-approved account while major health and safety issues remain unresolved.</p>
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Laws about rent escrow are extremely state-specific. In some places, you may be allowed
            to use rent escrow when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The unit is uninhabitable or unsafe</li>
            <li>You have given proper written notice about repairs</li>
            <li>The landlord has been given a reasonable time but has not fixed the problem</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Do not stop paying rent or use rent escrow without legal guidance.</strong> Improper withholding can lead to
            eviction. Contact your local tenant legal aid or use the <a href="legal-help.html">Get Legal Help</a> page for support.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>If all roommates are on the same lease, the landlord may treat all tenants as jointly responsible for the full rent.
            If one roommate leaves, the remaining tenants may still owe the full amount.</p>
          <p>To protect yourself:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a written roommate agreement that explains how rent and utilities are split</li>
            <li>Keep track of who pays what and when</li>
            <li>Communicate early if someone is considering leaving</li>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Often you can, but there may be financial penalties unless state law gives you protections. Common options include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Paying a lease-break fee if your lease allows it</li>
            <li>Finding a qualified replacement tenant, if permitted</li>
            <li>Continuing to pay rent until the landlord re-rents the unit</li>

          <p>Some states offer extra protections for tenants leaving due to domestic violence, unsafe conditions, or military orders.

            <li><strong>Fixed-term renewal:</strong> you sign a new 6–12+ month lease, often with a rent increase</li>
            <li><strong>Month-to-month:</strong> continues one month at a time; rent or terms can often change with proper notice</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Always ask:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“How much notice do I need to give if I don’t want to renew?”</li>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Eviction is a legal process where a landlord asks a court for permission to remove a tenant from a rental unit.
            Common reasons include nonpayment of rent, serious lease violations, or illegal activity.</p>
          <p>Basic protections (which vary by state) often include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Written notice before an eviction case is filed</li>
            <li>The right to a court hearing</li>
            <li>The right to present evidence and defenses</li>
            <li>Landlords generally cannot lock you out, shut off utilities, or remove your belongings without a court order</li>
          </ul>
